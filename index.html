    <aside class="about">
        <p>
        Here are some terms you will see in relation to computer hardware.
        </p>

        <button class="accordion">SSD Versus HDD</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Hard Disk Drives and Solid State Drives (devices) both store data permanently. SSDs are newer, and do not have the moving parts of their older equivalent - HDD. SSD are made from interconnected flash memory cells,similar to those in a USB drive (thumb drive or flash drive). SSDs are more reliable and more robust than the HDD equivalent.
                        </p>
        </div> 
           
            <button class="accordion">Storage - RAM Versus SSD</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
               The SSD (or HDD) stores data permanently on disk. Computer memory is just temporary storage, and the contents of RAM go away when the power goes.
                            </p>
                            <p>RAM is regarded as <i>primary storage</i> because it is the immediate storage, whereas saving data to an SSD or a HDD is regarded as saving to <i>secondary storage</i>.</p>
            </div>    
       <!-- BIOS -->
       <button class="accordion">BIOS</button>
       <div class="panel">
         <p>Basic Input Output System.</p>
         <p>This is contained in a chip, inserted onto the motherboard by the motherboard manufacturer. The BIOS has instructions for loading the computer hardware. It includes POST (Power-On Self-Test) test, that verifies the computer can boot up. If the computer fails POST, a combination of beeps indicates the malfunction.
           
            </p>
       </div>       
<!-- Form factor -->
<button class="accordion">Form Factor</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Form factor refers to the size, shape, and physical specifications of hardware or hardware components. The term applies to cases, motherboards, PSUs and more. Form factor is very important for determing connection compatibility.</p>

</div> 
<!-- Heatsinks and fans -->
<button class="accordion">Heatsinks & Fans</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A heat sink and fan (HSF) is an active cooling solution used to cool down integrated circuits in computer systems, commonly the central processing unit (CPU). A heat sink unit is composed of a metal alloy, formed into conductive fingers - this  passive cooling unit draws heat away from the source, and the fan dissipates the heat.</p>

</div> 
<!-- USB -->
<button class="accordion">USB</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Universal Serial Bus(USB) technology used to connect computers with peripheral devices. A USB port is a standardized way to connect a wide range of devices to a computer. Also referred to as <i>Plug & Play</i>.</p>

</div> 
<!-- Ports -->
<button class="accordion">Ports</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A port is a connector with which an external device can be connected to the computer. Information flows between the connected device and the computer, through the port.</p>
<p>There are several ports designated wth numbers, that are programmatic docking points through which information flows from a program to the computer, or over the Internet.</p>
